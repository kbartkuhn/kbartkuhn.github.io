gradually whisk in milk until smooth. COOK over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. 
STIR IN vanilla. Remove from heat.

ADD remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tbsp. at a time, beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved. (Rub a bit of mixture
between thumb and forefinger; it should feel completely smooth.) Continue beating until whites are glossy and stand in soft peaks.

 no streaks of white remain. Carefully POUR into ungreased 1-1/2 to 2-quart soufflé dish. For a “top hat”, hold metal

 back and forth, 30 to 40 minutes. SERVE IMMEDIATELY.
